								<h2>Robin Hood's Cash Stash ("Myths and Legends" themed College Project)(Final Major Project Year 1)</h2>
							</header>
							<a href="https://youtu.be/sgr949x__cM" class="image left"><img src="images/RH1.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								This is the a project that I spent <b> 12 weeks completing as my Final Major Project for my first year at College </b>.
								This was built using a 3D model pack found on the Unity asset store as well as <b> code completely written by myself </b>.
								The game includes custom player physics, which allows for more precise control over the player's movements and actions,
								allowing for a game that feels better to play as well as a completely open 3D world in which the player can easily test
								and experiment with their increased modility. This game was based off the "Robin Hood" legend and so the <b> gameplay elements
								are focused on mobility and ranged attacks as well as the map, which is designed for the player to move in the most remote
								and efficient way possible, </b> imitating the rogue archer from the legend. Overall, this was a very enjoyable project which
								contains a potent creative personality from my humble beginnings as a game developer.

								<h2>Rapture Run (Culture themed College Project)</h2>
							</header>
							<a href="https://youtu.be/pJQiKP4dirc" class="image left"><img src="images/RR2.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							This is a project that I completed in 4 weeks as part of my focus into cultural influence within the creative industry.
							This project was built using a <b> background drawn within Adobe Photoshop by myself as well as code written by myself</b>.
							This game includes an <b> infinitely generating level with randomised obstacles </b> which fit well with the general "arcade" aesthetic
							I wished to achieve. On top of including an infinitely scrolling level, the <b> background art is fully tileable </b> and automatically duplicates
							itself in front of the camera and deletes itself when out of the camera's sight, enabling the game to include a constant parallax effect.
							Moreover, the <b> player movement includes a dynamic jump </b> which is determined on the duration that the "jump" key
							is held as well as a velocity based X axis movement to make the player comfortable with the multiple physics-based interactions within
							the level. Overall, this was an effective project in learning how to wield infinite level generation in regards to a 2 dimentional scene.

								<h2>Untitled Space Game ("Arcade" themed College Project)(Final Major Project Year 2)</h2>
							</header>
							<a href="https://youtu.be/nP4K4uKzLL0" class="image left"><img src="images/USG1.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								This is a project that I spent 12 weeks on as my final major project for my second year at College. This is the first game in which I created 
								and implemented <b>self-made 3D models </b>as well as integrate <b>sound effects into the players actions, making the game feel more responsive </b>to the player's
								input. This project is built using a <b>random number generator </b>which gives a number between 1 and 5, corresponding to the positions that obstacles can
								be instantiated. The number chosen is translated into an array, which then chooses the spawnpoint with the corresponding number, leaving a gap for
								the player to move through. Due to this method of randomised level creation, the <b>levels are infinitely generated on a 3D axis, allowing for
								sophisticated levels of mobility </b>for the player and a wide range of "creative freedom" for future additions to the project.Overall, this was an effective 
								project in learning how to wield infinite level generation in regards to a 3 dimentional scene as well as learning how to keep my creative options open
								and ready for future changes.

								<h2>2DPSWAI (2D Platform Shooter With AI)</h2>
							</header>
							<a href="https://youtu.be/cAL4_70XUO4" class="image left"><img src="images/PSWAI1.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>This was a project that I completed in a 1 week break. This is the first game which included <b>basic enemy AI within a 2D space </b>as well as my first attempt at a dynamic 
								jump mechanic which gives the player better control over their movement. The enemy movement was completed through the use of <b>a timer which would activate a script at
								random intervals, adding a varied force to the enemys which gave the illuion of them jumping </b>towards the player whilst shooting, giving them both and offensive and
								defensive nature. I also added different enemy variants to fit different situations within the levels which <b>added variation to the player's expectations,</b> leading to the 
								atmosphere becoming tense with anticipation. The dyanmic jump mechanic was created thorugh the use of a delayed fall during the input of the spacebar, allowing the player
								to hold the spacebar and remain in the air for a prolonged amount of time.
