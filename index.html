									<h2>My name is Conner Smith</h2>
									<p>
										<br>
										<br>
										Hello! I am an indie game developer from the United Kingdom, and I have been programming and experimenting with creating games since I was 12. I have always taken an interest
										in the creation process of many iconic mechanics from beloved games such as placeable portals from "Portal" and grappling hooks from the "Just Cause" series which both help to
										make their repectible franchises memorable and fun. <br>
										Here you can see some of the projects that I have had the opportunity of contributing to, and some of the personal projects and experiments I have been working on. I have a strong
										perseverance for learning new things and taking risks as well as tackling challenges, in order to make sure that I can grow as an individual as well as a creator overall. I have always
										been immensely curious in the technical side of games, and this is the drive for my future ambitions and projects.

								As a side project, a select few people from my course (me included), were given the opportunity to visit Frontier Developments to take part in last minute QA testing before the game's release.
								We were given the task of playing through the tutorials and introduction levels and document any bugs or issues that we experienced. I decided to focus on player experience instead of technical or
								graphical issues and managed to document and bring to light some issues with the placement tool, which was quickly fixed before release.
