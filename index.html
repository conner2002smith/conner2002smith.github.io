									<h2>My name is Conner Smith</h2>

									<p>
										<br>
										Hello! I am an indie game developer from the United Kingdom, and I have been programming and experimenting with creating games since I was 12. I have always taken an interest
										in the creation process of many iconic mechanics from beloved games such as placeable portals from "Portal" and grappling hooks from the "Just Cause" series which both help to
										make their repectible franchises memorable and fun. <br>
										Here you can see some of the projects that I have had the opportunity of contributing to, and some of the personal projects and experiments I have been working on. I have a strong
										perseverance for learning new things and taking risks as well as tackling challenges, in order to make sure that I can grow as an individual as well as a creator overall. I have always
										been immensely curious in the technical side of games, and this is the drive for my future ambitions and projects.

										<h2>Very Hungry Catterpillar (Book themed College Project)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://youtu.be/8iDLdHMLXAo" class="image fit"><img src="images/C2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a project that I completed within 4 weeks based around a book called "The Very Hungry Catterpillar". This was the first Unity game that I made using self made art assets as well
										as original code that included basic movement, pause menu, and collection of items such as collectibles.
										<br>
										Highlights:
										<br>
										• First game in Unity and C#
										<br>
										• 100% Self made assets
										<br>
										• Includes first attempt at storing scores

										<h2>Robin Hood's Cash Stash ("Myths and Legends" themed College Project)(Final Major Project Year 1)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://youtu.be/sgr949x__cM" class="image fit"><img src="images/RH1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a project that I spent 12 weeks on as my final major project for my first year at College. This was the first 3D game that I made with the use of imported 3D models as well
										as a fully explorable world with enemies that react to the player's behaviour.
										<br>
										Highlights:
										<br>
										• First 3D game in Unity
										<br>
										• Fully coded the player physics
										<br>
										• Sophisticated enemy AI
										<br>
										• Advanced UI (minimap)

										<h2>Rapture Run (Culture themed College Project)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://youtu.be/pJQiKP4dirc" class="image main"><img src="images/RR2.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This is a project that I completed in 4 weeks. This is the first Unity game that I made which included accessibility options such as difficulty settings and a colour-blind friendly colour pallet
									as well as my first attempt at a randomised, infinite level with randomly spawning obstacles. Moreover, I fully created a background art piece which was completely tileable.
									<br>
									Highlights:
									<br>
									• Accessibility focused gameplay
									<br>
									• Procedural level generation
									<br>
									• Self-painted art assets

										<h2>Coin Campo ("One More Go" themed College Project)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://youtu.be/aWWMDnBdapI" class="image fit"><img src="images/OMG1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a project that I completed within 6 weeks based around the theme of wanting "One More Go". This is the first game I made that experimented with multiple pathways within a 2D space as well as
										different obstacles such as the key/door system which allowed for the player's pacing and advancements to be controlled.
										<br>
										Highlights:
										<br>
										• Dynamic level Design
										<br>
										• High focus on player maneuverability
										<br>
										• Time/Score hybrid for high score creation

								</header>
								<a href="https://youtu.be/cAL4_70XUO4" class="image fit"><img src="images/PSWAI1.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This was a project that I completed in a 2 week break. This is the first game which included basic enemy AI within a 2D space as well as my first attempt at a dynamic jump mechanic which gives the player
									 better control over their movement. I also added different enemy variants to fit different situations within the levels.
									 <br>
									 Highlights:
									 <br>
									 • Enemy variation in accordance to level design
									 <br>
									 • Enemy AI within a 2D space
									 <br>
									 • Dynamic jumping

								As a side project, a select few people from my course (me included), were given the opportunity to visit Frontier Developments to take part in last minute QA testing before the game's release.
								We were given the task of playing through the tutorials and introduction levels and document any bugs or issues that we experienced. I decided to focus on player experience instead of technical or
								graphical issues and managed to document and bring to light some issues with the placement tool, which was quickly fixed before release.
